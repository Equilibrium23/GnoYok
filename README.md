# GnoYok

## Don't waste, share it!

We have a lot of things which we don't longer need. 
Instead of throwing it away (which creates waste!) what is there is someone who actually need it?

However how to reach such person?

In response to such this need we created the GnoYok!

## If you want to find something:

Just open GnoYok and it will show you what people near you want to share.

Select categories that interest you, search radius and start looking.

If you found something interesting, you just click a link to go directly to Google Maps directions or find bus/tram connection at JakDojade.pl (because we love public transport). Truly frictionless experience!


## If you have something to share:

GnoYok allows you to add thing to share. Enter name, description, address and contact information. GnoYok will automatically place it on the map where you will for people to find.

# Running GnoYok

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
